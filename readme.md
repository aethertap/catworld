# CatWorld - 4x cat invasion

The cats are going to dominate the Earth, and beyond. This is a silly game made for educational purposes to teach programming in typescript. 

## Setup

You need node 21+. 

1. `nvm use node`
1. `npm i`
1. `npm run build`
1. `npm run run`

For tests: `npm run test`

## About

The game is a very simple event loop driven by console input for now. It'll probably turn into a 2d top-down view at some point, as the cat armies grow and become more complex.
